This app takes four data pieces from a user to construct a bike or run map loop with directions.

1 - user's device location
2 - Maximum number of parks to visit
3 - Radius distance for search
4 - Type of directions wanted (Bike or Run)


The app takes this user input and returns the following:

    - updated map with a highlighted route around parks that starts and ends at the location that the user initially intiated the search
    - Summary of results
        - Total Park Stops
        - Total Mileage
        - Estimated Time to finish loop
    - Turn by turn directions
        - Each individual direction can be clicked on to display it's position on the map


There are also two buttons, a locate and restart button:

    - Locate - initiates a geolocation call and displays the device's current location
    - Restart - this button appears after you submit your initial request.  Clicking it restarts the app.
